# Social-KPI---Graduation-Project

My friends and I are information system engineering students at the Technion.
As a part of our studies we had to work on a final project that combines the knowledge we gained during the last four years of our studies.

In our society where the socio-economic gaps are getting wider, loneliness has become a common phenomenon, and health issues can negatively impact quality of life, many families find themselves struggling to survive.

SoCity main goal is to enable the authorities to make data-driven decisions about social issues and turn the spotlight on households at risk, so they can help them.
In this project we collected data from the local authorities in order to calculate social measures for life quality, as defined by “Joint” organization.

SoCity gives you the opportunity to see those measures on a map, so you can get spatial understanding regarding the population at risk.
